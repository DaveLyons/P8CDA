P8CDA Notes          v2.0

David A. Lyons  31-Jul-88
=========================

  o  P8CDA can now load Permanent Initialization Files (PIF, $B6)
     and (TIF, $B7) files as well as CDAs.  To have P8CDA load
     PIF and TIF files, put them in the SYSTEM/SYSTEM.SETUP
     directory.  ($B6 files are also known as STR, Startup files;
     $B7 files are also known as TSF, Temporary Startup Files.)

  o  When P8CDA is run from a command shell and passed the
     pathname of a CDA, PIF, or TIF to load, any errors that
     occur are no longer fatal--P8CDA quits back to the command
     shell when a key is pressed.

  o  A CDA can find its pathname at $280 the first time its
     ShutDown entry is called if P8CDA loads it.  PIF/TIF files
     can also find the pathname there when they are executed.
     The pathname may be complete or partial.
