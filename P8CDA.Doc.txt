Documentation for P8CDA v1.2

by David A. Lyons   7-Mar-88
============================


-------
Purpose
-------
P8CDA lets IIgs users load Classic Desk Accessories (CDAs) without
booting ProDOS 16.  CDAs appear when Apple-Ctrl-ESC is typed; the
Control Panel is a CDA that is built into the Apple IIgs ROM.

P8CDA can be installed on any ProDOS volume, including 5.25" drives,
3.5" drives, hard drives, and RAM drives.


----------------
Shareware notice
----------------
P8CDA is Shareware for the Apple IIgs.  You are encouraged to
give copies of it to users groups, friends, bulletin boards,
and whatever else you can think of.  Try it out for ten days.
If it's useful to you, send in the $10 registration fee.
(You may send $15 instead of $10 and receive a 3.5" disk with
the latest version of P8CDA, plus some public domain utilities
from DAL Systems.)

Registered users will be notified of any updates to P8CDA and
are eligible for technical support.

Your honesty will allow me to continue distributing low-cost
utilities for the Apple II.

Please send your comments on P8CDA to DAL Systems on GEnie or
CompuServe or by mail (addresses are at the top of this file).

----------------
Revision History
----------------
v1.2:
  P8CDA v1.1 was unable to run the next SYS application correctly
  when the volume it was run from had a 15-character name.  A
  fatal error message ("P8CDA: Fatal error=0046" -- file not
  found) was the result.

  v1.2 enables interrupts (by executing a CLI instruction);
  booting from the Disk Port (port 6) could leave interrupts
  disabled.

v1.1:
  P8CDA v1.1 makes a patch to ProDOS 1.4 (in RAM, not on disk)
  to prevent "MLI Error $FF" messages or other strange behavior
  in CDAs which check ProDOS's "busy" flag before making ProDOS
  calls.  See the "ProDOS busy-flag bug" section below for more
  details.

  Also, ProDOS 16 calls are now trapped nicely.  Instead of
  getting dropped in the monitor when a CDA tries to call ProDOS
  16, you get the message "P8CDA: A CDA tried to call ProDOS 16".

  Finally, a bug was fixed which sometimes caused Fatal errors
  ($0040, bad pathname) when CDA files had been _deleted_.
  v1.0 was trying to load them anyway!)


--------------------
Typical Installation
--------------------
Most users will want to insert P8CDA as an invisible part of the
boot sequence on a ProDOS 8 disk.  Any kind of ProDOS disk will
work (3.5", 5.25", Hard drive, RAM disk, ROM disk, or whatever
you have).

  -- Copy the P8 file from the SYSTEM directory of a ProDOS 16
     disk into the main directory of your ProDOS 8 disk, and
     call it PRODOS.  (This is *not* the same as the file called
     PRODOS on a ProDOS 16 disk.)

  -- Put P8CDA.SYSTEM in the main directory, and make sure it's the
     first .SYSTEM file.  Create a SYSTEM directory, and create a
     DESK.ACCS directory inside the SYSTEM directory.

  -- Put all the CDAs (filetype=$B9) you want to load inside the
     DESK.ACCS directory.  IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE, START WITH JUST
     A COUPLE CDAs AND ADD THEM ONE AT A TIME, REBOOTING EACH TIME
     TO SEE WHICH CDAs ARE CAUSING THE PROBLEM.  Then refer to
     "What should I do if my CDAs don't work?" below.

  -- Put the .SYSTEM file you want to boot into *after* P8CDA.SYSTEM
     in your main directory.

  -- Reboot, and you can use Apple-Ctrl-ESC to get to the Desk
     Accessories menu!  [Hold down the Apple key during boot to
     get a title screen for P8CDA.]

Once P8CDA loads your CDAs, it scans the main directory for the
first .SYSTEM file *after* P8CDA.SYSTEM and runs it.  (If you
change the name to something other than P8CDA.SYSTEM, it won't
be able to find itself.)

If P8CDA can't find another .SYSTEM file to run, it just does a
ProDOS "QUIT" call.  If you have a fancied-up QUIT patched into
your ProDOS, this may actually be useful.


------------------
Installation notes
------------------
If you already have other .SYSTEM files in your directory and do
not wish to change their names, there are a couple of things you
could do:

  (1) If you have a utility that lets you rearrange entries in
      your directory, use it to put P8CDA.SYSTEM first.

  (2) Otherwise, use any program that can COPY files to make
      a second copy of the first .SYSTEM file in your directory,
      and give the copy a different name.  Then DELETE the first
      copy, copy P8CDA.SYSTEM onto the disk [it takes the place
      of the file you just deleted], and RENAME the copied file
      back to its original name.

Of course, if you have another program that behaves like P8CDA
and runs the *next* .SYSTEM file, P8CDA.SYSTEM does not need
to be first!  But it still has to come before any program that
doesn't run the next .SYSTEM file.

The SYSTEM and SYSTEM/DESK.ACCS directories are already present
on a ProDOS 16 disk; P8CDA uses the same names to (1) avoid
confusion, and (2) let you make a copy of your favorite ProDOS 16
disk and just delete all the stuff you don't need; the CDAs will
be in the right place already.


----------------------
Alternate installation
----------------------
If you have a utility like SETUP.SYSTEM (see November, 1987
Call-A.P.P.L.E., pp. 14-23), you can put P8CDA.SYSTEM in your
SETUPS directory, and put all the CDAs in there, too.  When
P8CDA sees that the Prefix is not set to the main directory,
it will look where the Prefix is set (instead of in SYSTEM/
DESK.ACCS).

You can also put both SETUP.SYSTEM and P8CDA.SYSTEM in the
main directory (and put the CDAs in SYSTEM/DESK.ACCS).  If
you do this, you will have to put P8CDA.SYSTEM *after*
SETUP.SYSTEM.  This is because SETUP.SYSTEM is a bit lazy;
it runs the _second_ .SYSTEM file in your directory.  This
scheme will fail if SETUP.SYSTEM _is_ the second one!

If you put SETUP.SYSTEM first, it will do its thing and then
run P8CDA.SYSTEM.  P8CDA will do its thing and run the .SYSTEM
file *after* itself.


-----
Notes
-----
If you hold down the Apple key while P8CDA is running, you will
see a title screen with a Shareware notice.  Near the bottom of
the screen will be a _version number_ and a "Press a key" prompt.
When you press a key, P8CDA continues and displays the name of
each CDA as it is loaded.

If you are getting any error messages when loading your CDAs,
this will let you find out which CDA was being loaded when the
problem occured.

Error $0201 means all the available RAM is in use.  Solutions,
in order of preference:

  -- Decrease the size of your RAM disk (/RAM5) if you are
     using it.
  -- Get a bigger RAM card.
  -- Don't load so many CDAs.
  -- Hold down the Option key while P8CDA is loading.  This
     allows the CDAs to use the last 16K of the super-hires
     display.  [This feature is intended for IIgs owners with
     only 256K.  If you have a RAM expansion card, decreasing
     your RAM disk size is a much better idea.]

     * If you will be running any programs that use Super-hires,
       do NOT hold down Option while P8CDA is loading!

     * Do NOT use the Option feature if you have patched AppleWorks
       to reset the shadow register on exit, unless your patch
       preserves the status of the "shadow super-hires" bit.


--------------------------------
Using P8CDA from a command shell
--------------------------------
If you have a command shell like Davex or ECP-8, you can run
P8CDA from it.  If you pass a pathname to P8CDA, it will try
to load the specified CDA.

If you don't pass a pathname, it will try to load all the CDAs
in the directory your prefix is set to.  Once P8CDA does its
thing, it returns you to your command shell (by doing a ProDOS
"QUIT" call).


---------------------------
Does it work with ALL CDAs?
---------------------------
No.  The major source of trouble is CDAs which call ProDOS 16
when they are initialized without first checking that it is
available.  If this happens, you will be get an appropriate
error message from P8CDA.

CDAs containing dynamic segments or initialization segments
will not work with P8CDA.


---------------------------------------
What should I do if my CDAs don't work?
---------------------------------------
If you find a CDA that tries to call ProDOS 16, contact the CDA's
author and explain that the CDA should check that the value at
E1/00BC (1 byte) is $01 before making any ProDOS 16 calls. [See
_Apple IIgs ProDOS 16 Reference_, APDA Draft of 13-Nov-86, p30.]

(The assumption that ProDOS 16 is available when a CDA is loaded
is a pretty reasonable one.  But under P8CDA, it is false.)

If you find any CDAs that don't work with P8CDA (and don't display
a reasonable error message), I want to know about it.  (If the CDA
is public domain or Shareware, it will help if you send me a copy
or tell me where to get one.)

Nifty List v2.1 (and some earlier versions) recklessly calls
ProDOS 16 to load its data file.  Nifty List 2.2 and up check to see
if ProDOS 16 is available before trying to load the data file (under
P8CDA, Nifty List 2.2+ will work, but no tool names or ProDOS names
will be available, making it considerably less useful.)


--------------------
ProDOS busy-flag bug
--------------------
P8CDA (v1.1+) patches ProDOS in RAM (not on your disk) if the
"MLIACTV" bug has not already been patched in your copy of
ProDOS. The bug results in bogus "MLI Error $FF" messages from
CDAs which check the MLIACTV flag before making ProDOS 8 calls.
ProDOS 8 1.4 often leaves this flag set even when ProDOS is
_not_ busy.  The patch consists of changing the byte at $DE8F
from $0E (ASL) to $4E (LSR).  P8CDA makes this patch only if
$DE90-1 contain $BF9B (the address of the MLIACTV flag).  [All
of this is in the "$C08B" bank of the language card space.]

(This applies to some versions of ProDOS prior to 1.4, and I
wouldn't be surprised if it applied to some future versions,
too.)

To permanently patch this and other bugs in ProDOS on your disks,
use the PATCHP.FP program available from DL1 in CompuServe's
APPLEII forum (among other places).


-----------------
Technical details
-----------------
P8CDA supports the old (v1.0) and new (v2.0) Object Module Formats,
and multiple-segment CDAs are supported.  However, only static
code segments and static data segments are supported.  Dynamic
segments are not supported and will not be.  Init segments are
not supported, but could be if there is a demand for it.

There are no CDAs that I know of that use dynamic segments or
initialization segments.

ROM 01's InstallCDA function returns error $0F05 rather than $0501
when the Desk Accessories menu is full.  Weird, eh?  (This happens
only when the ROM is used "cold," not when TOOL.SETUP has been
loaded.)

P8CDA does not report any error if the Desk Accessories menu is
full.

If $0800..BFFF in banks 0 and 1 is not allocated, P8CDA requests
a $30xx ID (from the miscellaneous toolset) and allocates that RAM
with NewHandle.

If you hold down the Option key, P8CDA allows the CDAs to reside
in "special memory."  In this case, $E0/2000..5FFF and
$E1/2000..5FFF are allocated, and shadowing for the Super-hires
display is disabled (bit $08 of the Shadow register at $C035 is
set).  The end result:  holding down Option allows 16K of extra
RAM ($E1/6000..9FFF) to be used for CDAs.


---------------------
Multiple-segment CDAs
---------------------
Most CDAs consist of only one segment, but P8CDA can load CDAs
with up to 255 segments.

Note that Glen Bredon's Master CDA does NOT support multiple-
segment CDAs, and cannot reasonably be expected to.  (The Master
Builder program would have to change the segment numbers on all
inter-segment references in the CDAs; for SUPER records in OMF
v2.0 CDAs, this would usually result in some segment numbers
greater than 12, which cannot be represented in SUPER records!)

Once a Master CDA is built, it *is* a multiple-segment CDA, with
one segment for each CDA it controls [so it can't be used inside
another Master CDA!].

CDAs produced using TML Pascal have at least two segments, so
they do not work under control of a Master CDA.  (TML Pascal v1.1
has a $CDA directive that allows CDAs to be generated easily.)
